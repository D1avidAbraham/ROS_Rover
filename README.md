# ROS_Rover

# Differential-drive robot (DDR)
There are only two axis that this robot can move, the x-axis and the y-axis. 
The x-axis aligns with the forward motion of the robot and the y-axis aligns with the axis of wheel rotation. 

A configuration space, denoted by $q$ specifies the locations on the robot.
