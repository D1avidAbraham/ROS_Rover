# Planning 

## Part A - Three Ws
* why am I making this project <br>
	I am making this project to further my understanding of ROS and AI. Also it would be a a good Resume builder 
* who is this project for <br>
	This project is mainly for myself 
* what is gonna make it valuable <br>
	I get to learn about ROS, AI and improve resume

##  Part B - User Stories 

* The Robot should be able to drive around
* The Robot should be able to use a depth camera
* The Robot should be able to use Libar 
* The Robot should be able to grab things 
* The Robot should be able to move autonomously  
* The Robot should be able to move based of a LLM/VLM 
* The Robot should be able to be controled by a user (teleoperations)
* The Robot should code should be in a docker container 
* The Robot should have a custume PCB that 
* The Robot should use an IMU to calulate the location of the robot
* The Robot should be able to control the motors with Pulse Width Modulation 

## Part C - data models

NA

## Part D - MVP 

* Able to move based on User commands
* Able to use H-bridge to control the two DC motors
* Able to read the encoders in the DC motors
* Use Arduino to control H-bridge and read the encoders
* Communicate between the arduino and the raspberry pi using serial 
* Read Camera data 
* Read libar data 


E. 
Draw a stupid simple prototype
G. 
Understand what the future of my project is going to look like 
H. 
Drill into the components 
architecture of the project -- spend a lot of time here 
I. 
Picking your stack 
pick the tool that does the job the best and the simplest 
J.
overall development process 
- create a project skeleton
		- basic folder structure
		- development environments 
		- version control
* setting up the database and creating data models
	  - build the backend routes
		  - API endpoints
    - Frontend interface 
	    - Connect to backend
	- project interaction
